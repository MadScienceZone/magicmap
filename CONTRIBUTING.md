# Contributing to the Magic Map
Normally, work on the magic maps in the game is done by the game developers (wizards) who are assigned to maintenance of the realm maps.
However, we welcome feedback, suggestions, and if you feel so inclined, pull requests. We can't guarantee we'll incorporate any of the above, but as time allows
we will take a look and consider any suggestions we get and see if they fit in our vision for this tool.
