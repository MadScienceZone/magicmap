Ragnarok MUD Magic Mapper Client 3.0.0a1 (ALPHA RELEASE) 

This is MagicMapper, a client for playing the Ragnarok MUD game.  It is 
designed to be simple and flexible, and not tied to any proprietary
operating system or development platform.  It should run equally well on
a Macintosh, Windows, or Linux/Unix system.

This program may be used as a stand-alone (but very basic) MUD-playing
client which includes the ability to graphically display the Ragnarok
Magic Map while you explore.  Alternatively, it may be used to just
display the map while you use another client of your choosing.

This is an EXPERIMENTAL DEVELOPMENT RELEASE (alpha).  It is still
very much a work in progress, and not yet ready for widespread use.  If
you would like to get an early preview of the software and/or assist with
testing and providing feedback to the developer, feel free to do so, but
don't expect a solid, finished product yet.  See the RELEASE_NOTES file
for more information.

The official documentation for the MagicMapper, both from an end-user 
perspective as well as for developers of the in-game map files and
compatible clients, is on the Ragnarok technical wiki:
