Ragnarok MUD Magic Mapper Client Installation Notes

Prerequisites:
  Before beginning, check that your system includes the following software.
    * Python 2.6 or later (This application has not been tested for Python 3.x
      and most likely will not work.)

  To install Python, go to http://python.org and download the installation
  package appropriate for your system.
      
______________________________________________________________________________
(1) Unpack the Magic Mapper distribution into a temporary working directory,
    and change to that directory.

       $ tar xvzf MagicMapper-0.1a2.tar.gz
       $ cd MagicMapper-0.1a2

______________________________________________________________________________
(2) If you wish to validate the Magic Mapper, you may run the unit tests
    which will check out its internal code to make sure it produces the
    expected results.  The simplest way to do this is:

       $ cd Test
       $ ./texttestrunner
       $ cd ..

______________________________________________________________________________
(3) To install the Magic Mapper onto your system, just run:

       $ python setup.py install

     You will need sufficient permissions to write the class library
     files into your Python site_packages directory and the user scripts
     into a public bin directory (usually /usr/bin by default).  You may
     choose to have setup.py install these files into another location
     (for example, if you want them installed in your own home directory).
     To see the list of options you can give to the setup script, run:

           $ python setup.py install --help

     In particular, you probably want to use --home if installing MagicMapper
     locally in your home directory, or --prefix, --install-purelib,
     and/or --install-scripts if you are an administrator wishing to
     install into a non-standard directory.

________________________________________________________________________________
(4) Note that the documentation files under the "man" directory are not
    installed anywhere by default.  If you want the documents added
    to your "man" command, copy these into the appropriate manpage
    directories on your system.  PDF copies of these documents are also
    available under the "man/pdf" directory.  You can copy these where
    you can refer to them as needed.
