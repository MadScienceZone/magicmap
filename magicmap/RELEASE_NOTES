CURRENT RELEASE:
  Magic Mapper 3.0.0a1 30-SEP-2010
    **ALPHA TEST RELEASE**
    
    This represents a wholesale reimplementation of major portions
    of MSH as well as a substantial amount of new code.  The visual
    magic mapper is the main new feature, which MSH never did (although
    it was planned to do so at some point).  The project was ported from
    Tcl to Python as part of the rewrite.

    Renamed from MSH to MagicMapper but kept advancing the version numbers
    from 2.12 to 3.0 in acknowledgement of its previous history as MSH.

    Bug fixes: legion
    Additions: also legion

  KNOWN ISSUES:
    Not all functions are implemented.  It's fairly easy to confuse with
    bad or unexpected input files.

PREVIOUS VERSIONS:

  MSH 2.12
    New icon button panel, graphical status indicators.  Notebook tabs
    on configure screen (avoids the dialog from getting too long).
    Added "transcript" logging (toggle on/off) as well as old feature
    to save entire buffer.  Changed ESC-[J (clear screen) to actually
    clear entire buffer (previously just printed several newlines).
    Added more informative status messages when downloading images.

  MSH 2.10:
    Includes support for the new RML command.

  MSH 2.9:
    Allows you to configure the color of your game input as it appears
    on the output window, and turn off the box drawn around it if you
    prefer.

    Also implements image cache ageing.

    **IF YOU USED MSH 2.5-2.7, YOU WILL NEED TO DELETE YOUR CACHE
    **FILES BEFORE USING 2.8 or 2.9.  IF YOU ARE GOING FROM 2.4 OR
    **EARLIER STRAIGHT TO 2.8 or 2.9, THIS IS NOT NECESSARY.
	
  MSH 2.8: (unreleased) image cache implemented
  MSH 2.7: (unreleased) bug fixes to 2.6
  MSH 2.6: (unreleased) bug fixes to 2.5

  MSH 2.5:
    You can now expand the window

    MSH now accepts graphic images which may be sent from the MUD
    to display in-line in your MUD session window.

    The default MSH directory is now ~/msh, allowing you to upgrade MSH
    to a new version without moving your files over to a new directory
    each time.

    MSH now lets you configure the size of the window and the colors
    you use in the game.  These may be saved.

    General improvements and hooks for future enhancements.
